        <h3>Description :</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            The FAMAS is a bullpup assault rifle featured in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, Call of Duty: Black Ops,
            Call of Duty: Black Ops Declassified, Call of Duty Online, Call of Duty: Mobile, Call of Duty: Modern
            Warfare, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Campaign Remastered. It was cut from Call of Duty 4: Modern
            Warfare.
            <br>
            <br>
            The FAMAS is unlocked once Create-a-class is unlocked.
            <br>
            <br>
            The FAMAS is a high damage per bullet weapon, a sharp contrast to what the create-a-class stat bars suggest.
            At any range short of fifty meters, the FAMAS will deal 40 damage, dealing a three shot kill, or a two shot
            kill if hitting the head. The FAMAS will decrease in damage linearly until 62 meters, where it will deal 30
            damage, netting a four shot kill, or a three shot kill with headshots. The FAMAS loses its one burst kill
            potential at 57 meters, and will always retain one shot kill potential in Hardcore under normal
            circumstances. The FAMAS has moderate bullet penetration power. The FAMAS' three shot kill potential is only
            bested by the FAL in terms of assault rifles.
            <br>
            <br>
            With Stopping Power equipped, the shots to kill at all ranges reduces by one, making the FAMAS a one burst
            kill at any distance, and, for the most part, a two shot kill.
            <br>
            <br>
            The FAMAS' rate of fire is overall slow. It fires in a burst fire configuration, and the FAMAS' overall rate
            of fire will clock in at only 477 RPM, only besting the M16A4 out of Assault Rifles in terms of fire rate.
            In each burst, however, the FAMAS' rate of fire is 1016 RPM; coupled with the FAMAS' high damage, and its
            one burst kill gives it a very fast time-to-kill ratio.
            <br>
            <br>
            The FAMAS has odd accuracy traits. The iron sights are clean, and the recoil is quite low, kicking uniquely
            upwards; however, the FAMAS has a very low centerspeed value of 1200. In conjunction with the high rate of
            fire, the FAMAS' recoil will climb during the burst. The recoil will resettle between each burst, but
            overall, the FAMAS' accuracy plays second chair to the M16A4, the FAMAS' biggest competitor.
            <br>
            <br>
            The FAMAS has average handling traits. Its switch speeds are moderately good for an Assault Rifle, the FAMAS
            aims in a quarter second, the FAMAS has a moderately sized hip-fire spread, and the FAMAS will allow the
            user to move at 95% of the base speed, and 38% when aiming. The FAMAS' reload speed is bad, however, and is
            tied for the slowest assault rifle reload with the F2000, taking at least 2.06 seconds to Reload Cancel the
            FAMAS. Due to the FAMAS' burst fire, high damage nature, reloads won't be too frequent, but will place the
            player in danger in a heated gunfight.
            <br>
            <br>
            The FAMAS' magazine capacity is the typical thirty rounds. The player will spawn in the game with three
            magazines total for the FAMAS.
            <br>
            <br>
            The FAMAS gets the typical assault rifle attachments on offer. The Grenade Launcher is a very powerful
            attachment, and the FAMAS, which isn't completely reliant on Stopping Power, can do well on an explosive
            class. The Shotgun is not very useful at all in core game modes due to its poor damage, making the FAMAS the
            more reliable weapon from the hip. However, the shotgun's extreme range and damage characteristics make it a
            deadly choice in Hardcore, where one shot kills become exponentially more reliable.
            <br>
            <br>
            The low zoom sights are good choices on the FAMAS, due to its dependence on one burst kills. The Red Dot
            Sight and Holographic Sight are good choices should the player want them. However, it is inadvisable to use
            the ACOG Scope or the Thermal Scope, as the FAMAS' already terrible centerspeed is reduced even further,
            making one burst kills much less consistent.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Silencer is a decent attachment to consider on the FAMAS. Even with a Silencer equipped, the FAMAS has
            respectable range, making it a good weapon to use a Silencer on.
            <br>
            <br>
            FMJ makes the FAMAS much more effective at shooting through thin cover. FMJ is the best overall attachment
            on the FAMAS, as it compliments the weapon's powerful playstyle and gives the player a powerful advantage by
            being able to shoot enemies with extreme effectiveness through walls.
