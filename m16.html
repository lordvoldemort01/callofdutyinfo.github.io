        <h3>Description :</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The M16 is an assault rifle featured in Call of Duty: Black Ops, Call of Duty: Black Ops: Declassified, Call
            of Duty: Advanced Warfare, Call of Duty: Black Ops III, Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, Call of Duty: Mobile and
            Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War.
            <br>
            <br>
            The M16 is a free weapon unlocked in one of the default classes at level 1, equipped with an ASP, and with
            the perks Scavenger, Steady Aim, and Second Chance.
            <br>
            <br>
            The M16 is a higher damage weapon. One whole burst will usually suffice, but at longer ranges, an extra
            bullet may be required, thus an extra burst. The headshot multiplier allows for one less bullet, allowing
            for one accurate burst to kill an enemy from afar. This high damage is offset due to the M16 having the
            lowest "overall" RPM of all assault rifles, at a measly 459 RPM. The bullets shot in one burst will fly at
            937 RPM. Both of these speeds are slower than the G11. The M16 has regular penetration.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the accuracy department, the M16 is generally deemed inferior to the G11, and in general, accuracy is
            decent. The iron sights can confuse some users, and the recoil is high enough to throw off aim with
            consecutively shot bursts. Allowing a window of delay between bursts will allow this recoil to settle.
            <br>
            <br>
            Handling of the M16 remains normal. ADS time is on par with the other assault rifles, and the hip-fire
            spread is a moderate size. However, the M16 has a very fast reload time, at 2.03 seconds regular, or 2.36
            seconds for an empty reload. Reload cancelling can further hasten this already swift reload.
            <br>
            <br>
            The M16 has the usual assortment of attachment options. Optical attachments can work very well with this
            weapon. For regular engagements, the Red Dot Sight or the Reflex Sight will serve better at medium range if
            the user dislikes the iron sights. The ACOG Scope works better at long range, and strangely, will reduce
            recoil instead of increase it, making it extremely accurate as a marksman-infantry hybrid weapon. The
            Infrared Scope, like the ACOG, actually decreases recoil and spread even further, effectively turning this
            weapon into a 3 round burst sniper. Keep in mind though, that Ghost Pro users will not show up on the scope,
            blending into the background..
            <br>
            <br>
            Due to the M16's nature, Extended Mags and Dual Mags are often not as viable on the M16, as the M16 isn't
            hard-pressed for ammunition like the FAMAS or AUG, and the M16 doesn't necessarily chew up its magazine. If
            another attachment is needed, it's not recommended to use these over the other attachment.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Suppressor will cut down on the M16's range, resulting in more hitmarkers compared to without. However,
            a player that finds themselves shooting more than 1 burst most of the time on an enemy will find minimal
            drawback from this attachment.
            <br>
            <br>
            The underbarrel attachments are available, and can work very well on the M16 if close range prowess is
            wanted. The Masterkey and the Flamethrower prove to be very deadly up close. The drawbacks to both of these
            attachments should be considered, such as the Flamethrower being rendered useless against a Flak Jacket pro
            user, and the Masterkey's very low time to kill if the first shot misses. Also keep in mind that you cannot
            combine this with any other attachment with Warlord nor replenish niether of these attachments with
            Scavenger.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Grenade Launcher will give a good medium-range weapon capable of clearing rooms or objective points with
            relative ease. However, its high cost, the inability to combine attachments with Warlord, and that you only
            get 2 grenades to use which cannot be replenished with Scavenger , make its use less popular.
            <br>
            <br>
            In conclusion, the M16 is a very versatile weapon at medium ranges. What it lacks in close quarters combat,
            it makes up for it with great viability at gunfights from afar, and that the M16 is a free weapon to use.
            These aspects alone make it a commonplace weapon for players who prestige, and with players who just start
            playing the game.
