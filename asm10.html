        <h3>Description :</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The ASM10 is also called AN-94 is an assault rifle that appears in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare: Mobilized,
            Call of Duty: Black
            Ops II, Call of Duty: Strike Team, Call of Duty Online, Call of Duty: Black Ops III, Call of Duty: Black Ops
            4, Call of Duty: Mobile and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.

            The AN-94 is the last weapon to be unlocked in the assault rifle category, and is unlocked at level 55.
            <br>
            <br>

            The AN-94 is a moderately high damage per bullet assault rifle. At any range short of 29m, the AN-94 will
            deal forty damage per bullet, needing three shots to kill. At any range between 29m and 56m, the AN-94 will
            deal 33 damage per bullet, needing four shots to kill, or three if one bullet is a headshot. At any range
            beyond 56m, the AN-94 will deal 24 damage per bullet, taking five shots to kill - four if one bullet hits
            the head. The AN-94 is a one shot kill in Hardcore out to 56m, and the AN-94 has medium penetration power.
            For a fully automatic assault rifle, the AN-94 has one of the better damage profiles in the class, with the
            three shot kill range only being bested by the SCAR-H as far as fully automatic assault rifles go.
            <br>
            <br>
            AN-94 has a variable rate of fire. The first two rounds in a burst (the period that the player holds down
            the trigger) are fired at 937 RPM, whereas all other shots in the burst are fired at a more lethargic 625
            RPM. Ceasing to fire will reset the enhanced fire rate for the next burst. The AN-94 can be extremely deadly
            if the user gets either of the first two bullets to land, but after the first two shots, the low fire rate
            starts to take a toll on the AN-94's close range effectiveness.
            <br>
            <br>
            AN-94's accuracy is a mixed bag. The iron sights are some of the clearest in the game, with little
            obstruction around the central post, but the recoil can be somewhat annoying. The horizontal recoil is small
            enough and not an issue, but the problem is that the AN-94 has no downwards recoil value, meaning the AN-94
            always kicks upwards. Thankfully, both of the AN-94's upwards recoil values aren't too large, but it means
            that the user will be responsible for counteracting this recoil. The first shot in a burst for the AN-94 has
            5% less recoil per shot, a trait unique to the AN-94 in the assault rifle category. This recoil reduction is
            very slight, but certainly helps. The recoil becomes much more manageable after the first two shots. The
            centerspeed of the AN-94 is 1500, an average value.
            <br>
            <br>
            The handling traits of the AN-94 are run of the mill. Users move at 95% of the base speed, or 40% when
            strafing. The hip-fire spread is of an average size, and the aim down sight time is average, at 250ms. The
            AN-94's reload speeds are quite good for an assault rifle, taking 2.47s for a partial reload, or 3.1s for an
            empty reload. In either case, a Reload Cancel can be performed after 1.35s. This reload cancel speed is very
            fast - only bested by the SCAR-H among all assault rifles - and mastering the reload cancel will eliminate
            the need for Fast Mag.
            <br>
            <br>
            The AN-94 has the assault rifle standard 30 round magazine capacity, and 120 round starting ammo loadout.
            <br>
            <br>
            The AN-94 has the standard assortment of attachments available to it. Reflex Sight and EOTech Sight are both
            a waste on the AN-94. The AN-94 has no need for an optical sight at all, given how clean the iron sights
            are. These sights can be seen as a downgrade, seeing how being under the effects of an EMP can take out the
            reticle for these sights, whereas the iron sights deal with no such weakness. Anyways, if players feel more
            comfortable with these than the iron sights, it is still fine to use them.
