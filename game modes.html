                members of 8 to 10. The two team fight with
                each other to get the kill cap but within a given time limit.

            <li>
                <h3 class="game-mode-subheading">Free For All</h3> : This mode is real Deathmatch along with
                Activision’s
                insight to hunting down any players.
                There will be no team and win strategy is based on the highest kill.
                However, the player who is having the highest number of kills, 20 is the maximum to wins the game.
            </li>


            <li>
                <h3 class="game-mode-subheading">Frontline</h3> : Frontline Mode is one of the default game modes in
                Call
                of Duty : Mobile, available to be played
                on Nuketown, Crossfire, Crash, Hijacked, Killhouse.
                Each team would spawn at their own base then make their way to the battlefield to destroy the other
                team.
                The first team to reach 50 kills wins the match.
            </li>


            <li>
                <h3 class="game-mode-subheading">Hardpoint</h3> : The teams must rush to secure a "hardpoint" on the map
                and repel the area from the enemies.
                Holding the hardpoint increases the teams' score, but if no players are in the hardpoint, no points are
                gained. It is similar to Headquarters, but respawning is always enabled, even if the player's team is
                holding the hardpoint. The Hardpoint switches to different set rotational positions on the map several
                times
                during the match. A point is granted every second a single team is present in the Hardpoint.

                If players from both teams are present in the Hardpoint, it will be marked as "contested" and neither
                team
                will gain points until remaining enemies are removed from the objective. Players who arrive in a new
                Hardpoint or one that was previously occupied by enemies gains 200 score for "Securing the Hardpoint"
