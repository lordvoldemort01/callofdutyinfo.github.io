        <h3>Description :</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The Type 25 (called Type 95 in the game files) is a bullpup assault rifle featured in Call of Duty: Black Ops
            II, Call of Duty: Strike Team and Call of Duty: Mobile.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Type 25 is the second weapon in the assault rifle category, unlocked as soon as Create-a-class is
            unlocked, but still requires an unlock token.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Type 25 has low damage per shot for an assault rifle. At any range short of 37.5 meters, the Type 25
            will deal 33 damage per bullet, taking four shots to kill. At any range beyond 37.5 meters, the Type 25 will
            deal 24 damage per bullet, taking five shots to kill, or two in Hardcore game types. Headshots will reduce
            the number of shots needed to kill by one, but not in Hardcore. The Type 25 also has medium penetration
            power. The Type 25 has some of the lowest damage per bullet of any assault rifle, only rivalling the M27 in
            this regard. Thankfully, the four shot kill range is decent, so the user won't need five shots to kill too
            often.
            <br>
            <br>
            On the contrary, the Type 25's rate of fire is fantastic, at 937 RPM. This is the highest such value in the
            assault rifle class, and the second highest default rate of fire in the game. This makes the Type 25
            competitive at medium ranges and close quarters combat.
            <br>
            <br>
            Accuracy is moderate on the Type 25. The iron sights are of an unusual form, but easy enough to use. The
            recoil per shot goes up and to the right, with minimal kick to the left. The Type 25's centerspeed is also
            fantastic, at 1700. Although the Type 25's rate of fire is high, the recoil is very controllable, and
            players can comfortably shoot the Type 25 fully automatic at medium ranges. Although the recoil profile is
            small, the rate of fire is too high for long range engagements, and going full auto at such a distance will
            easily cause the gun to drift off of target.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Type 25's handling characteristics are great for an assault rifle. The Type 25 has the best base
            movement speed in its class, at 96.5% of the base speed, 1.5% higher than the other assault rifles. However,
            the strafe speed remains the paltry 40% standard mark for assault rifles. The hip-fire spread of the Type 25
            is also the smallest in its class, having a slightly tighter hip-fire spread. The Type 25, however, has some
            of the slower reloads in its class, taking 2.375 seconds to do a partial reload, 3.05 seconds to do an empty
            reload, and 1.7 seconds to perform a Reload Cancel. These reload times aren't bad overall, but remains only
            faster than the lethargic SMR in the assault rifle class. The enhanced rate of fire and low damage also
            means that the Type 25 will make reloads frequent.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Type 25 has the standard 30 round magazine capacity and 120 round starting ammo loadout.
            The standard assortment of attachments are available to the Type 25.
            The Reflex Sight provides a basic alternative to the iron sights. This attachment's value entirely depends
            on if the user is content with using the iron sights are not.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Quickdraw Handle is a very nice attachment option for the Type 25, as it cuts the aim down sight time in
            half. Users can snap onto target very quickly, an attribute that very much suits the Type 25. The Type 25 is
            best used in a more aggressive role to take advantage of its superior handling traits, and the Quickdraw
            Handle improves aggressive capability. The Adjustable Stock heavily improves the Type 25's strafe speed to
            80% instead of the poor 40%, allowing for quick movement when strafing. This attribute gels very well with
            the Type 25's aggressive playstyle.
            <br>
            <br>
            Fast Mag decreases the reload times of the Type 25, making reloads much more tolerable. The Type 25 chews
            through ammo quickly, and as such, this attachment will prove to be very popular with many. Fast Mag will
            also increase the rate at which the underbarrel Grenade Launcher reloads, if it is equipped. As such, Fast
            Mag is extremely valuable if using the Grenade Launcher. On the other side of the coin, Extended Clip will
            increase the Type 25's magazine capacity from thirty rounds per magazine to forty rounds, and increase the
            starting ammo loadout from 120 rounds to 160 rounds. Extended Clip can be a nice alternative to Scavenger
            should one not want to use said perk.
            <br>
            <br>
            The EOTech Sight and ACOG Scope provide higher zoom alternatives to the iron sights, allowing for clearer
            definition at longer ranges. Both also provide an accuracy increase in the form of a very slight centerspeed
            bonus. These two attachments are best left for weapons that'll see the bulk of their usage at medium to long
            ranges, which the Type 25 isn't suited for.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Foregrip provides a tiny centerspeed increase, comprable to the increase the ACOG Scope gives. Although
            the Foregrip has no intrinsic downside, the benefit it gives is so small that it's a waste of an attachment
            choice regardless.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Target Finder gives a longer ranged, target acquiring sight that illuminates those without Cold Blooded
            with a bright red diamond. This allows for easier target acquisition, especially in dark rooms. However,
            this attachment, like the EOTech Sight and ACOG Scope, are best left to longer ranged weapons.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Laser Sight tightens the Type 25's hip-fire spread immensely. Given that the Type 25 already has a
            tighter than usual hip-fire box, this attachment can really bolster the Type 25's hip-fire effectiveness.
            One thing to note about the Laser Sight is that it is mounted on the top Picatinny Rail of the weapon, and
            as such, the Laser Sighting module will partially obstruct the bottom of the iron sights.
            <br>
            <br>
            Select Fire enables the Type 25 to be fired in a burst fire configuration. When used in the burst fire
            configuration, there is no burst delay, and the Type 25's centerspeed is increased to 1800. This makes the
            Type 25 even more accurate at medium to long ranges and can assist in ammo conservation. That being said,
            the attachment's worth is questionable, as the Type 25 doesn't have great damage for medium to long range
            engagements. Still, the extra 100 centerspeed alone makes this attachment worth a look.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Suppressor is an excellent fit on the Type 25, as the rate of fire is high, the differential in maximum
            to minimum damage is small, and the Type 25's accuracy is good. The Suppressor allows the Type 25 to
            effectively be used as a stealth weapon.
            <br>
            <br>
            FMJ is an ill fit on the Type 25. FMJ brings its usual benefit of increasing the penetration power. The
            issue is that the Type 25 isn't geared towards being used with FMJ. The Type 25's damage isn't that great,
            and it isn't designed to be used in a defensive role, where FMJ is best utilized. The attachment doesn't
            have downside, but it's not worth using on the Type 25.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Hybrid Optic gives a close and long range optic that the user can switch between at his/her leisure.
            This attachment is best used for players who don't like to use the iron sights, but can't decide between the
            Reflex Sight or the ACOG Scope.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Grenade Launcher gives two grenades which can be launched from the Type 25 at a parabolic arc. The
            Grenade Launcher can be used to kill opponents lodged in enclosed areas. Flak Jacket users will prove to be
            incredibly hard to kill with the Grenade Launcher, though.
            <br>
            <br>
            The MMS gives an extremely low zoom level optic that scans the environment, and can illuminate opponents
            standing still. The MMS is very limited in function, as opponents must be standing still, be at a close
            enough range, and not be using Cold Blooded. On top of that, the Type 25 isn't built to use the MMS well, as
            it only has medium penetration power. For the most part, the only benefits the MMS provides are the very low
            zoom level and the large viewing area in the sight.
