        <h3>Description :</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The AK-47 is an assault rifle featured in many games of the Modern Warfare and Black Ops series, as well as
            in Call of Duty Online, Call of Duty: Heroes, Rightful King, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare and Call of
            Duty: Mobile.
            <br>
            <br>
            The AK-47 is one of the first assault rifles unlocked in multiplayer, being available as soon as
            Create-a-Class is unlocked. It is a high-damage, slow-firing assault rifle on par with the M16A4 and MP44.
            <br>
            <br>
            The AK-47 deals 48-35 damage depending on range, killing targets in three-to-four shots. Head shots
            generally reduce the number of bullets needed to kill by one. Equipping Stopping Power reduces this to
            two-to-three shots. In this case, head shots only help outside of effective range. The moderate rate of fire
            and the high damage per bullet gives the AK-47 among the fastest times to kill out of all the fully
            automatic assault rifles.
            <br>
            <br>
            The AK-47 has higher recoil than most of the other assault rifles, with a recoil pattern of 60 up, left, and
            right, and 30 down. Its centerspeed is average, at 1500. The recoil is symmetrical so while the weapon
            bounces around somewhat while firing recoil tends to go straight up. Reload speed is at 2.5 seconds loaded
            or 3.25 unloaded, making it somewhat slower than the M4 Carbine or G36C, but not by much.
            <br>
            <br>
            The AK-47 has the same amount of sway as the M4 Carbine and same sway speed as the G36C. The GP-25 and the
            ACOG Scope are the two most suitable attachments to use as the Red Dot Sight and Suppressor both limit its
            effectiveness; equipping either of the latter reduces minimum damage to 20, making it take five shots at
            range to kill in core and essentially making it a slower-firing M4 Carbine or G36C. This damage reduction
            also causes the gun to lose its one shot kill ability at range in hardcore. While the ACOG doesn't cause
            this damage reduction, the increased zoom, ADS time, and recoil hamper much of the AK-47's close range
            effectiveness, and the increase in idle sway will also somewhat hamper its middle range effectiveness. The
            AK-47 is perhaps most versatile when used bare, with no attachments, as it leaves the player with a weapon
            that does not hamper itself or their class selection.
            <br>
            <br>
            In Hardcore, it kills in one hit against all enemies unless they are using Juggernaut (which can be negated
            with Stopping Power) or Last Stand, or those shot through cover, but loses this ability with a Suppressor or
            Red Dot Sight attached. The AK-47 can accept Golden Camouflage once all of the Assault Rifle challenges are
            completed. This exclusivity is nullified in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered, as all weapons can
            accept Gold Camouflage.
