        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Crash is a medium-sized multiplayer map featured in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and Call of Duty: Modern
            Warfare Remastered as well as Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 as part of the Stimulus Package and Call of
            Duty: Mobile. Crash is also available in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare it was added as part of the Season One
            content for the game.
            <br>
            <br>
            A Night version of Crash is available on Call of Duty: Mobile and was added on November 11, 2020 as part of
            the Season 12 Going Dark update. It is exclusive of the Night mode.
            <br>
            <br>
            The map is relatively small compared to other maps and plays host to intense and fast paced matches. There
            are many blind corners, narrow corridors, and dark areas, all of which encourage players to camp. It also
            provides fast paced Free-For-All and team games. Conversely, there are large open spaces and high rooftops
            which allow players to snipe. Airborne Killstreak Rewards such as the Harrier Strikes or Attack Helicopters
            have limited effect due to the high availability of cover. Conversely, UAVs can help root out the players
            that are taking cover. The thin walls allow players using Deep Impact or FMJ to kill people window camping,
            or those defending bombs in Search and Destroy or Demolition.
            <br>
            <br>
            In Modern Warfare, doors were added around the map.
            <br>
            <br>
            Crash appears in Old School Mode as a supported map. It features a total of 10 sprites. The sprites are exactly the same as Winter Crash.
