        <h3>Description :</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            The HVK-30 is an assault rifle featured in Call of Duty: Black Ops III and Call of Duty: Mobile.
            <br>
            <br>
            The HVK-30 is unlocked at level 2. It is a high fire rate assault rifle with moderate recoil, low damage,
            and tight hip fire spread. It has the second highest overall fire rate of the Assault Rifles, and is only
            matched or bested by the SMGs, the Dingo, the RK5, and the FFAR. It deals a low 30 to 22 damage, tied with
            the M8A7 for the lowest damage assault rifle.
            <br>
            <br>
            While it has low damage, its range is very good. It will be a four hit kill up to 51 meters, and a five hit
            kill past that. The rifle's moderate, but easily controllable recoil, helps it retain its effectiveness and
            ease of use out to such ranges. Still, the Foregrip is an effective attachment to consider, if one wishes to
            make the HVK-30 even more deadly and easy to use at these longer ranges.
            <br>
            <br>
            While the suppressor's range detriment is noticeable on the HVK-30, its low damage difference, high fire
            rate, and better performance than other assault rifles in close range makes the Suppressor a fairly good
            choice if the player wants to maintain stealth.
            <br>
            <br>
            High Caliber can be useful if a player actively aims for the head or is attempting to complete headshot
            challenges.
            <br>
            <br>
            Rapid Fire, although significantly weaker in Black Ops III compared to other games, is much more noticeable
            and effective on the HVK-30 because of its already high fire rate, pushing it up to 780 RPM.
            <br>
            <br>
            The HVK-30's high fire rate and average damage profile may make Extended Mags or Fast Mags a worthy choice
            by increasing clip size and/or speeding up reloads. With either of these attachments the HVK-30 can sustain
            fire longer or get back in the fight faster and play to its aggressive, fast-firing nature.
            <br>
            <br>
            Long Barrel is a questionable attachment for the HVK-30; it doubles the range of the weapon, as with most
            other weapons in class, but the 4 shot range is already very good, so it can be seen as overkill to push the
            HVK-30's 4 shot range out to over 100 meters, especially considering how rarely such gunfights occur. Using
            it in conjunction with the suppressor, however, can be useful, as it will keep the player from the radar
            while mitigating the severe range penalty of the suppressor.
            <br>
            <br>
            The HVK-30 has similar hipfire spread to that of the SMGs when moving, which makes it very effective at
            close range and an excellent candidate for the Laser Sight. This attachment will cut its hipfire spread down
            by over 50%, which can help save time by allowing a player to get accurate fire on a target without the need
            to aim down sight. The Quickdraw and Stock attachments further bolster its already superb handling for a
            more aggressive rushing user.
            <br>
            <br>
            It is very useful within a close range, where the higher fire rate and lower hip spread allow it to compete
            with other close range weaponry (such as shotguns and SMGs). However, the low recoil and tremendous range
            makes the HVK-30 very powerful at mid and long range as well. It also has a slightly faster than usual
            sprint out time, at 0.275 seconds instead of the regular 0.3 seconds. These characteristics make the HVK-30
            a capable all-range assault rifle.
