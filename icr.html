        <h3>Description :</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The ICR-1 is an assault rifle appearing in Call of Duty: Black Ops III and Call of Duty: Mobile.
            <br>
            <br>
            The ICR-1 is unlocked at level 16.
            <br>
            <br>
            The ICR-1 is a low-damage-per-bullet assault rifle. At most ranges, the ICR-1 will take either four to five
            shots to kill. This is low for the assault rifle class, and is tied with the HVK-30 and M8A7 for the lowest
            damage per shot in its class. Unlike the HVK-30, the ICR-1 also possesses an average fire rate, making the
            ICR-1's time-to-kill ratio quite slow. The ICR-1 has medium penetration, and in Hardcore game modes, the
            ICR-1 is generally hit-or-miss in terms of one shot kills. Its one shot kill range is good at best, and
            won't match weapons like the XR-2, Man-O-War, or the M8A7 in terms of lethality.
            <br>
            <br>
            The ICR-1's fire rate, as already stated, is average for its class. The ICR-1 will fire at 600 RPM. This
            rate of fire is slow overall, but for the assault rifle class, it is quite good, and is only outdone by the
            HVK-30 and just barely by the KN-44 in terms of overall fire rate. Due to its low rate of fire, this makes
            the ICR-1 have a long time-to-kill ratio in comparison to other assault rifles.
            <br>
            <br>
            The ICR-1's selling point is its extreme accuracy. The ICR-1 has good iron sights, and the recoil per shot
            is very low, as the weapon kicks both minimally and predictably and, due to the average rate of fire, allows
            the center-speed to counteract a lot of the recoil.
            <br>
            <br>
            The ICR-1 has a 30 round magazine capacity, which is standard for the assault rifle class. Due to the
            ICR-1's low damage, reloads may be more frequent. However, the slower fire rate may also help alleviate this
            somewhat.
            <br>
            <br>
            The ICR-1 has the standard assortment of attachments in its class available to it. The optical attachments
            are worth considering, as some players might not like the iron sights due to the somewhat large rear sight.
            Optics can give better clarity of targets making target acquisition and focusing on targets easier.
            <br>
            <br>
            The magazine modifying attachments, Extended Mag and Fast Mag, are well worth considering. The ICR-1 uses a
            lot of ammunition due to its lower damage per shot. The default reload time is already fairly fast, at just
            over two seconds, which makes Extended Mag a much more valuable option.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Adjustable Stock and Quickdraw Handle are good options for the ICR-1, which fits best as a medium range
            assault rifle. With these two attachments, its performance increases, allowing the user to aim quickly and
            avoid incoming fire easier.
            <br>
            <br>
            FMJ isn't the best attachment to consider on the ICR-1, as its low damage per bullet discourages players
            from shooting through walls. High Caliber, however, is a great attachment to use on the ICR-1, as the
            increased headshot multiplier allows players to potentially net three hit kills with a headshot, making the
            ICR-1's time-to-kill profile much faster.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Laser Sight is a good attachment to consider, as it makes the ICR-1 more accurate when firing from the
            hip. The ICR-1 is one of the more forgiving assault rifles to fire from the hip thanks to its rate of fire,
            making the ICR-1 quite workable in close quarters. The Suppressor will cut down severely on the ICR-1's four
            shot kill range; however, due to the ICR-1's rate of fire, lower damage per bullet, and low damage
            differential, the ICR-1 is one of the best Assault Rifles to use a Suppressor with. The user is always at
            risk of losing a straight gunfight by a matter of one bullet, due to the ICR-1's low damage per shot. If the
            player can use the suppressor properly, the player will be able to easily take enemies by surprise, while
            not sacrificing too much in the form of power.
            <br>
            <br>
            Long Barrel is a good attachment to consider on the ICR-1, as it increases the ICR-1's four shot kill range,
            making it more powerful. This attachment is extremely powerful in Hardcore game modes, as Long Barrel will
            affect the one shot kill range of the ICR-1 positively, making Long Barrel a great choice for Hardcore game
            modes. Outside of Hardcore game modes, the Long Barrel is fairly decent, as the player will usually get the
            benefit of the long barrel in medium range combat.
