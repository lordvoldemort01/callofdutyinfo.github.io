        <h3>Description :</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            The Man-O-War is an assault rifle featured in Call of Duty: Black Ops III and Call of Duty: Mobile.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Man-O-War is unlocked at level 28, and costs one Unlock Token to unlock it. It is a high damage assault
            rifle with a low rate of fire and high recoil. It will kill in three shots out to 37.5 meters, and will be a
            four hit kill from any range beyond that. In Hardcore it will kill in one shot at all ranges.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Man-O-War's fire rate is low at 517 RPM. This is the slowest rate of fire for a fully automatic assault
            rifle, but its rate of fire overall will best that of the burst fire assault rifles and the Sheiva. Due to
            this, the Man-O-War isn't as dependent on accuracy as weapons such as the Sheiva.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Man-O-War's handling is quite poor. The iron sights are clean, but the recoil is high, kicking highly up
            and to the left. Its ADS time is the slowest within its class at 0.3 seconds, and it also exits slower after
            sprinting and moves slower while aiming and firing than all other assault rifles. Due to the Man-O-War's
            high recoil and slow handling, this will make the Man-O-War much less user friendly and capable in close
            ranges than other assault rifles.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Man-O-War's magazine capacity is standard for the assault rifle class, holding 30 rounds per magazine.
            Reloading isn't as frequent is other assault rifles thanks to the slightly lower rate of fire, but the
            recoil might make users waste bullets.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Man-O-War has the usual assortment of Assault rifle attachments. The optical attachments are valued
            based on the user's preference, and the range the player will most likely be using the Man-O-War. At longer
            distances, a long range sight may be desirable, but for medium ranges, the iron sights may be preferable to
            save space in the player's class for other, more tangibly beneficial attachments.
            <br>
            <br>
            Due to the Man-O-War's below average accuracy, the Foregrip is a very beneficial attachment, making the
            Man-O-War much more accurate. Due to the Man-O-War's lower rate of fire, this makes the recoil reduction
            more profound, as the Man-O-War's centerspeed has more time than other assault rifles to counteract the
            recoil between shots.
            <br>
            <br>
            High Caliber and FMJ will make the Man-O-War deal more damage through headshots and through cover,
            respectively. Both attachments are good fits for the Man-O-War, as its high damage per shot is improved in
            certain conditions with these attachments.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Quickdraw Handle and Adjustable Stock improve the Man-O-War's handling characteristics. These
            attachments aren't detrimental in any way, but if the player is playing in a more defensive role, these
            attachments may not be as useful.
            <br>
            <br>
            The magazine modifying attachments will increase either the magazine capacity or decrease the reload speed.
            In the right hands, the player won't commonly reload with the Man-O-War, making the value of these
            attachments questionable.
