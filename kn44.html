        <h3>Description :</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            The KN-44 (known as the ARAK in the alpha build and ARK-7 in the beta) is an assault rifle featured in Call
            of Duty: Black Ops III and its prequel comic, as well as in Call of Duty: Mobile. It also makes a brief
            physical appearance in Call of Duty: Black Ops 4. It has a moderate rate of fire, moderate recoil and a fast
            reload time.
            <br>
            <br>
            The KN-44 is unlocked right from the start of Multiplayer. It is one of the default guns, meaning it can be
            used from level 1.
            <br>
            <br>
            The KN-44 deals moderate damage. At any range short of 17.5 meters it will take three hits to kill. Past
            this range the KN-44 will be a four hit kill (in Hardcore, it will be a two hit kill past 50 meters). By
            default, the KN-44's headshot multiplier is only useful in Hardcore game modes, where the KN-44 can get a
            one headshot kill at any range. The KN-44 has medium penetration, as with most assault rifles.
            <br>
            <br>
            The KN-44 fires fully automatic at 625 RPM and is only bested by the HVK-30 and the FFAR. It may be above
            average as an assault rifle in this regard, but all SMGs can match or best this fire rate. The iron sights
            are clean, but the KN-44 has omni-directional recoil, kicking upwards and to the sides equally. As well, the
            KN-44 by default has the highest amount of idle sway in the assault rifle category, and one of the highest
            amounts of idle sway in the game. Only the Vesper and SVG-100 have more idle sway by default.
            <br>
            <br>
            The KN-44's handling characteristics are average for an Assault Rifle. It permits the user to move at 95%
            the base speed, 90% when firing the KN-44 while not aiming, and 38% when aiming the KN-44. The KN-44 has a
            moderately sized hip-fire spread and aims down the sights in 380 milliseconds. The KN-44 reloads fairly
            quickly, taking 2.03 seconds to reload the KN-44, 2.8 seconds if the KN-44 is empty, or 1.4 seconds to
            Reload Cancel the weapon.
            <br>
            <br>
            The KN-44 has a 30 round magazine for an Assault Rifle, and spawning in with four magazines total, or 120
            rounds by default.
            <br>
            <br>
            The KN-44 has the usual assortment of Assault Rifle attachments available to it. The Recon Sight will
            increase the KN-44's zoom level while aiming, increase the KN-44's centerspeed to 1575, and reduce idle sway
            by ninety percent, making the KN-44 much more accurate by almost fully eliminating idle sway. The Grip can
            help somewhat in reducing the KN-44's recoil also, but will not help improve overall accuracy as much as the
            Recon Sight.
            <br>
            <br>
            The KN-44 takes exception from other Assault Rifles with the Long Barrel and Suppressor attachments. Long
            Barrel will grant the KN-44 only 13% longer range values, and the Suppressor's range reduction on the KN-44
            is only 30%. This makes the Suppressor an overall stronger attachment on the KN-44, having lesser penalty
            and giving stealth bonuses.
